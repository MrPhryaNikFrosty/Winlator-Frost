# Useful Tips & Features of Winlator@Frost

- If you are experiencing performance issues, try changing the preset for Box86/Box64 in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab.
- For applications that use .NET Framework, try installing Wine Mono found in Start Menu -> System Tools.
- If some older games don't open, try adding the environment variable MESA_EXTENSION_MAX_YEAR=2003 in Container Settings -> Environment Variables.
- Try running the games using the shortcut on the Winlator home screen, there you can define individual settings for each game.
- If you want to hide the annoying dxvk hud, please untick `devinfo`, `frametimes` and `gpuload` in the environment variables inside the container settings. Or you can also delete the env `DXVK_HUD` but not recommended
- If you want to use VirGL in winlator version (7.1 and newer), make sure you change the env of `MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE`from `3.3COMPAT`to `2.1` or `3.1COMPAT`
For other version of winlator you can run it using `3.3COMPAT` or `4.0`
- Enabled the `BOX64_DYNAREC_WEAKBARRIER` can improve the performance for 64 bit games
- To display low resolution games correctly, try to enabling the `Force Fullscreen` option in the shortcut settings
- To speed up the installers, try changing the Box64 preset to `Intermediate` in Container Settings -> Advanced Tab
- You can now enable `MANGOHUD` for glibc version, not yet for proot
- For some unity games especially to fix unity games from crashing, try use stability preset and add `-force-gfx-direct -​force-d3d11-singlethread` in the exec arguments inside the shortcut of the unity games
- For some unity games, the games might not be able to launch in proot, so please try in glibc

# System requirement for Winlator@Frost
- Android - 8.0 or newer
- `Turnip` - For `Adreno 6xx and 7xx` only at the moment. `Adreno 8xx (8 elite, 7s gen 3), 720 (7 gen 3), and 710 (7s gen 2, 6 gen 3, 6 gen 1)` are not working. You have to use VirGL or Vortek if you're using this type of GPU.
- `Vortek` - Universal, all chips will work especially for unsupported turnip GPU but for now since it's under experimental so other chips `like Mediatek, Exynos, Kirin, Unisoc, etc` it won't work. So you have to wait for future releases of winlator
- `VirGL` - Universal, all chips `like Mediatek, Exynos, Kirin, Unisoc, etc`(include unsupport GPU of turnip adreno like in above)` might work with VirGL but you can only play DX9 games
- `LLVMPIPE` - Use this if you want to run software apps `(not for game)`

# What is the difference between bench and without bench apk? 
- Bench is for the user that have 2 or more winlator. It's suitable for the user to compare other winlator. While, without bench is for the user that don't have/install any winlator yet.
